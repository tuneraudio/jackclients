README:

This code creates a simple jack client that 
takes a specified biquad filter and processes audio passed to the client via
the jack audio server.

Overview:
To properly use this client you must run two separate processes.  
The first is the jack client (filter_client) which processes real time audio
and acts as a unix socket server, and the second is a unix socket client (commander) which
transmits requests to change the state of the real time filter.

Usage:
./filter_client	(in shell 1)

./commander	(in shell 2)
